# Android Clean Architecture

This project is a sample for the following principles.

 * Clean architecture principles(each layer(domain, data and presentation) has its own modules)
 * Feature base modularization(each page has its own modules)
 * Reactive MVVM (RMVVM which View actions pipe to the ViewModel. For instance see [this ViewModel](https://github.com/hadilq/CleanArchitucture/blob/master/presentation/albums-presentation/src/main/kotlin/com/gitlab/sample/presentation/album/rmvvm/AlbumViewModel.kt))
